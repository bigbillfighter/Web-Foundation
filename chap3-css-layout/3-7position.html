        When dogs have a job to do, 
        they give it their undivided attention. 
        <img src="./img/cat.png" alt="cat">
        It turns out people should probably do the same. 
        Stanford researchers found that attention and memory suffer in those who juggle work,
        email, and web-surfing, 
        compared to those who focus on one task at a time. 
        Other studies suggest employees actually lose time when multitasking.
