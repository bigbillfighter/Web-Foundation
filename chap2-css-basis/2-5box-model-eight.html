            <h1>Language</h1>
            <p>
                Language, a system of conventional spoken, manual (signed), 
                or written symbols by means of which human beings, 
                as members of a social group and participants in its culture, express themselves. 
                The functions of language include communication, the expression of identity, play, 
                imaginative expression, and emotional release.
